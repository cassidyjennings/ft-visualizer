# Fourier Transform Visualizer – Conventions

## Image Sizes
Allowed sizes (initial):
- 32 × 32
- 64 × 64
- 128 × 128
- 256 × 256

(Powers of two only for FFT simplicity and performance.)

## Image Representation
- Grayscale image
- Stored as `Uint8Array`
- Length = `width * height`
- Values in range `[0, 255]`

## FFT Representation
- Real and imaginary parts stored separately
- Type: `Float32Array`
- Same shape as image

## Visualization Defaults
- Magnitude displayed as: log(1 + sqrt(re^2 + im^2))
- Spectrum is **shifted by default** (DC centered)

## Normalization
- Forward FFT: unnormalized
- Inverse FFT: divide by `width * height`
